      <a id="understand"><h2> What are Smart Spaces? </h2></a>
      <p> Smart Spaces are contextually aware environments.  They understand who and what is present.  This website allows you to visualise and discover the people and things located in any given Smart Space right now. </p>
      <p> Click on anyone to discover what they're sharing via the circular icons.  And select one of three views: Who is present, What is present or the Social Scene. </p>
      <img src="/rootpage/images/interface.png">
      <p> Smart Spaces are equipped with sensors that identify people and objects via their wireless devices (see <a href="http://context.reelyactive.com/technology.html" target="_blank">reelyActive technology</a>).  Each person and object is linked with any digital content, which we call "stories", that they decide to share (learn how to <a href="#participate">participate</a>).  The result is a real-time digital understanding of the real world (what we call <a href="http://context.reelyactive.com/context.html" target="_blank">hyperlocal context</a>). </p>
      <a id="participate"><h2> How can I participate? </h2></a>
      <p> In order for a Smart Space to detect you and share your stories, you need to:
        <ul>
          <li> host your stories online
          <li> carry a uniquely identifiable wireless device (smartphone, wearable, etc.)
          <li> opt-in and associate your device with the link to your stories
        </ul>
        Curious?  Try <i>temporarily</i> participating in a Smart Space in two easy steps (no device required)!
